Hi everybody !
Global Training Days is coming up soon and we are excited to see you this weekend ! There are 41 attendees, 4 presentations on Friday and we got 10 trainers prepared to show you why Drupal can open doors and help you make something amazing.  
In case something came up and you can't attend the training, please let us know (reply to this email or by contact form from the website ), because the number of the seats are limited (the registration is already closed) and we would like to offer the chance to come to others. 

Have a nice week !
